## 1. Introduction
This is the final project of the Samsung Innovation Campus Artificial Intelligence Course, which is about detecting  human stress in and through the sleep by predicting stress level (Low, Medium Low, Medium, Medium High, and High) in the next day by building Machine Learning algorithms using Python with Sklearn. Below are details of the problem statement, a description of the dataset and tools we will be using for the project.

## 2. Problem Statement
One of the most important factors of life quality is stress. A stressful life is often unenjoyable and unfunctional. When stress levels increase, stress could impede normal daily life tasks resulting in the disruption of the individualâ€™s responsibilities. The quality of good or deep sleep plays a main role in the next day's stress level. Understanding the physiological changes such as the snoring, respiration rate, body temperature, limb movement rate, blood oxygen levels, eye movement, and number of hours of sleep during sleep helps in understanding the next day stress level. Hence, our aim in this project is to utilize data gathered from a dataset to predict the stress level using machine learning algorithms.

## 3. Dataset
The dataset is [Human Stress Detection](http://effectif.com/nesta) from Kaggle website, it contains 630 rows and 9 columns. For a better understanding of the database there is the description of the columns below:
| Variable | Definition |
| :--- |    :----   |
| sr |snoring rate |
| rr | respiration rate |
| t | body temperature |
| lm | limb movement |
| bo | blood oxygen |
| rem | eye movement |
| sh | sleeping hours |
| hr | heart rate |
| sl | stress level |

## 4. Tools
These are the technologies and libraries that we will be using for this project:

* Technologies: Python, Jupyter Notebook.
* Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, scipy, xgboost, Scikit-learn.
