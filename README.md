## 1. Introduction
This is the final project of the Samsung Innovation Camous AI Course, which is about detecting  human stress in and through the sleep by predicting stress level in the next days by building Machine Learning models using Python with Sklearn. Below are details of the problem statement, a description of the dataset and tools we will be using for the project.

## 2. Problem Statement


## 3. Dataset
The dataset is [Stress Detection](http://effectif.com/nesta) from Kaggle website, it contains 630 rows and 9 columns. For a better understanding of the database there is the description of the columns below:
| Variable | Definition |
| :--- |    :----   |
| sr |snoring rate |
| rr | respiration rate |
| t | body temperature |
| lm | limb movement |
| bo | blood oxygen |
| rem | eye movement |
| sh | sleeping hours |
| hr | heart rate |
| sl | stress level |

## 4. Tools
These are the technologies and libraries that we will be using for this project:

* Technologies: Python, Juypter Notebook.
* Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, scipy, xgboost, Scikit-learn.
